import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split # split into training and testing
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression # ML model
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error # give how good your model is
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score # tells how well the model explains the variance


## Load the data
data=pd.read_csv('student-mat.csv', sep=';')
features=data[["studytime", "absences", "G1", "G2"]] # give the features named here of every student
final_grades=data[["G3"]] # give their final grades

## Split into training/test
features_train,features_test,final_grades_train,final_grades_test=train_test_split(features,final_grades,test_size=0.2) # 80% training 20% test

## Train the model 
model=LinearRegression() # creation
model.fit(features_train,final_grades_train)

## Make a prediction
final_grades_predict=model.predict(features_test)

## Evaluate with RÂ² score and Mean Squared Error
squared_error=mean_squared_error(final_grades_test,final_grades_predict)
r2=r2_score(final_grades_test,final_grades_predict) # closer to 1 the better
print(f"Mean squared error: {squared_error} and R2 score: {r2}")
